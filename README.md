### Important Work
#### YOLO (You Only Look Once)

YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It applies a single neural network to the full image, which divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.

- **Paper**: [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)
- **Frameworks Used**: Darknet, OpenCV, PyTorch
- **Code**: [ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
